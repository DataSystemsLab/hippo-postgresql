// S16 Coding:
// In each block, we do not need to pad the last word with zero entries,
// because the coding method knows the block size and in the implementation,
// the decompression method will know where to stop.
// Each encoded word has a 4-bit header indicating which case was used to
// encode it. Thus, this limits the maximum integer that can be encoded to
// (2**28)-1.
