.SH NAME
NUMA_cpu_level_mask \- return mask of CPUs at given distance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libNUMA.h>

.BI "ssize_t NUMA_cpu_level_mask (size_t " destsize ", cpu_set_t *" dest ", size_t " srcsize ", const cpu_set_t *" src ", unsigned int " level );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR NUMA_cpu_level_mask ()
sets the bits corresponding to all CPU the are at or below distance
.IR level
from the CPUs with bits set in
.IR src
and set the bits for all the CPUs in
.IR dest .

Level 1 corresponds to all thread siblings of the input CPUs.  Level 2
corresponds to all core siblings.  Higher levels are measured by the access
cost of the memory.  For non-NUMA machines there is only one additional
level.  For NUMA machines there can be many different levels, depending
on the number of memory controllers in the system and the access times.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success
.BR NUMA_cpu_level_mask ()
returns a nonnegative number.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These interfaces are Linux-specific.
.SH BUGS
The information for levels 3 and higher depends on measures of access times
for the different sockets.  This information is often provided by the kernel
and it is plainly very often wrong.  Access times which differ in practice
are shown as equal.  The
.BR NUMA_cpu_level_mask ()
interface tries its best to provide the correct information.
