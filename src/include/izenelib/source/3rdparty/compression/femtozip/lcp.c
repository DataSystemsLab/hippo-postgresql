   int *lcp(const int *a, const char *s, int n)
   Precondition: a is suffix array for string s of
      length n *including* the terminating '\0'. 
   Return value: longest-common-prefix array; 0 on error.
   Reference: T. Kasai, G. Lee, H. Arimura, S.Arikawa
   and K. Park, "Linear-time longest-common-prefix
   computation in suffix arrays and its applications",

   lcp[x] is the length of the longest common prefix of
   suffixes s[a[x-1]..] and s[a[x]..].

   The algorithm determines the elements of lcp in the
   order that the suffixes occur in s.  It uses this fact:
   If the lcp for suffix s[i..] has length h, where h>0,
   then the lcp for suffix s[i+1..] is at least h-1.

   Proof.
   Let the immediate lexicographic predecessor of suffix
      s[i..] be s[j..], i.e. lex[i]=lex[j]+1.
   If s[i..] and s[j..] have a common prefix of length h,
      where h>0, then s[i+1..] and s[j+1..] have a common
      prefix of length h-1.
   Since s[i+1..] and s[j+1..] differ from s[i..] and s[j..]
      respectively only by the deletion of a common first
      letter, the two pairs must be similarly ordered.
      Hence s[j+1..] lexicographically precedes s[i+1..].
   Since s[i+1..] shares a common prefix of length h-1 with
      some lexicographic predecessor, namely s[j+1..], it
      must share a common prefix of length at least h-1 with
      its immediate predecessor.  Otherwise the suffix array 
      would be out of order.

   Running time is O(n).

   Proof.
   h is bounded by n; and h is decreased by 1 at most
   n times. Hence h is increased at most 2n times.
   This bounds the number of executions of the inner loop.
